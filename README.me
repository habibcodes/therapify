# Therapify

## Description
Complete fullstack webapp built on React, websockets, WebRTC, YoutubeAPI v3, and Reactive Calander API to bridge the divide between remote patients in need of mental health services and the practitioners who are willing to provide it. 

Therapify provides patients with the ability to browse uploaded media pertaining to CBT-based approaches to counseling. The video content is uploaded by practitioners specialising in a modality of treatment catering to diverse patient needs. Patients are able to search for Practitioners, request sessions on a particular date and time, and Practitioners are able to accept appointment requests. Sessions can be held over video chat or messaging, both of which are integrated on the platform. 

Therapify ensures that no matter how remote a person is, they will only be a click away from accredited, world class mental health professionals. At Therapify, no matter what you're going through --you will never walk alone!
